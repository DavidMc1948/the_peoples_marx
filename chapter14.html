<h2>The So-Called Primitive Accumulation </h2>

<p>(Extracted from vol. II, ch. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.) </p>

<p>We have seen how through capital surplus-value is made, and from surplus-value more capital. But the accumulation of capital presupposes surplus-value; surplus-value presupposes capitalistic production; capitalistic production presupposes the pre-existence of considerable masses of capital and of labour power in the hands of producers of commodities. The whole movement, therefore, seems to turn in a vicious circle, out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive accumulation preceding capitalistic accumulation; an accumulation not the result of the capitalist made of production, but its starting point. </p>

<p>Political Economy explains the origin of this primitive accumulation as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and, above all, frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, .and more, in riotous living. Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work. In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the great part. In the tender annals of Political Economy, the idyllic reigns from time immemorial. Right and labour were from all time the sole of enrichment, the present year of course always excepted. As a mailer of fact, the methods of primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic. </p>

<p>I he capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realise their labour. As soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs, it not only maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending scale. The process, therefore, that clears the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production. The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. </p>

<p>The economic structure of capitalistic society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society. The dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former. </p>

<p>The labourer could only dispose of his own person after he had ceased to be attached to the soil and ceased to be the slave, serf, or bondman of another. To become a free seller of labour power, who carries his commodity wherever he finds a market, he must further have escaped from the regime of the guilds, their rules for apprentices and journeymen, and the impediments of their labour regulations. Hence, the historical movement which changes the producers into wage-workers, appears, on the one hand, as their emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds, and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians. But, on the other hand, these new freemen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements. And the history of this, their expropriation, is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire. </p>

<p>The industrial capitalists, these new potentates, had on their part not only to displace the guild masters of handicrafts, but also the feudal lords, the possessors of the sources of wealth. In this respect their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of a victorious struggle both against feudal lordship and its revolting prerogatives, and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on the free development of production and the free exploitation of man by man. The <i>chevaliers d'industrie</i>, however, only succeeded in supplanting the knights of the sword by making use of events of which they themselves were wholly innocent. They have risen by means as vile as those by which the Roman freed-man once on a time made himself the master of his <i>patronus</i>. </p>

<p>The starting-point of the development that gave rise to the wage-labourer as well as to the capitalist, was the servitude of the labourer. -The advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude, in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation. To understand its march, we need not go back very far. Although we come across the first beginnings of capitalist production as early as the 14th or 15th century, sporadically, in certain towns of the Mediterranean, the capitalistic era dates from the 16th century. Wherever it appears, the abolition of serfdom has been long effected, and the highest development of the middle ages, the existence of sovereign towns, has been long on the wane. </p>

<p>In the history of primitive accumulation, those moments are particularly important, when great masses of men are suddenly and forcibly torn from their means of subsistence, and hurled as free and "unattached" proletarians on the labour market. The expropriation of the peasant from the soil, is the basis of the whole process. We will study the latter's history in England. </p>

<p>In England, serfdom had practically disappeared in the last part of the 14th century. The immense majority of the population consisted then, and to a still larger extent, in the 15 th century, <a href="#n1" name="ref1">[1]</a> of free peasant proprietors. In the larger seignorial domains, the old bailiff, himself a serf, was displaced by the free farmer. The wage-labourers of agriculture consisted partly of peasants, who utilised their leisure time by working on the large estates, partly of an independent special class of wage-labourers few in numbers. The latter also were practically at the same time peasant farmers, since, besides their wages, they had allotted to them arable land to the extent of 4 or more acres together with their cottages. Besides they, with the rest of the peasants, enjoyed the usufruct of the common land, which gave pasture to their cattle, furnished them with timber, fire-wood, turf, In all countries of Europe, feudal production is characterised by division of the soil amongst the greatest possible number of sub-feudatories. The might of the feudal lord, like that of the sovereign, depended not on the length of his rent roll, but on the number of his subjects, and the latter depended on the number of peasant proprietors. Although, therefore, the English land, after the Norman conquest (1066), was distributed in gigantic baronies, one of which often included some 900 of the old Anglo-Saxon lordships, it was bestrewn with small peasant properties, only here and there interspersed with great seignorial domains. Such conditions, together with the prosperity of the towns so characteristic of the 15 th century, allowed of much wealth of the people; but it excluded the possibility of capitalistic wealth. </p>

<p>The prelude of the revolution that laid the foundation of the capitalist mode of production, was played in the last third of the 15th, and the first third of the 16th century. A mass of free proletarians was hurled on the labour-market, by the breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers, who everywhere uselessly filled house and castle. Although the royal power, itself a product of bourgeois development, in its striving after absolute sovereignty, forcibly hastened on the dissolution of these bands of retainers, it was by no means the sole cause of it. In insolent conflict with king and parliament, the great feudal lords created an incomparably larger proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry from the land, to which the latter had the same feudal right as the lord himself, and by the usurpation of the common lands. The rapid rise of the Flemish wool manufactures, and the corresponding rise in the price of wool in England, gave the direct impulse to these evictions. The old nobility had been devoured by the great feudal wars. The new nobility was the child of its time, for which money was the power of all powers. Transformation of arable land into sheep-walks was, therefore, its cry. Harrison, in his Description of England, prefixed to Holinshed's Chronicle, describes how the expropriation of small peasants is ruining the country. The dwellings of the peasants and the cottages of the labourers were razed to the ground or doomed to decay. ?If?, says Harrison, ?the old records of every manour be sought .... it will soon appear that innumerable houses and small farms have disappeared, that the soil feeds far less people, that many towns are decayed, though a few new ones have arisen; .... Of towns and villages pulled down for sheep-walks, and no more but the lordships now standing- in them .... I could say somewhat?. The complaints of these old chroniclers are always exaggerated, but they reflect faithfully the impression made on contemporaries by the revolution in the conditions of production. </p>

<p>Legislation was terrified at this revolution. In his history of Henry VII, Bacon says: ?Inclosures at that time (1489) began to be more frequent, whereby arable land was turned into pasture, which was easily rid 'by a few herdsmen; and tenancies for years, lives, and at will (whereupon much of the yeomanry lived) were turned into demesnes. This bred a decay of people, and (by consequence) a decay of towns, churches, tithes, and the like .... In remedying of this inconvenience the king's wisdom was admirable, and the parliament's at that time .... They took a course to take away depopulating inclosures, and depopulating pasturage.? An Act of Henry VII., 1480, cap. 19. forbade the destruction of all ?houses of husbandry? to which at least 20 acres of land belonged. By an Act, 25 Henry VIII., the same law was renewed. It recites, among other things, ?that many farms and large flocks of cattle, especially of sheep, are concentrated in the hands of a few men whereby the rent of land has much risen and tillage has fallen off, churches and houses have been pulled down, and marvellous numbers of people have been deprived of the means wherewith to maintain themselves and their families.? The Act, therefore, ordains the rebuilding of the decayed farm-steads, and fixes a proportion between corn land and pasture land, &c. An Act of 1533 recites that some owners possess 24000 sheep, and limits the number to be owned to 2000. (In his <i>Utopia</i> 1516 Thomas More speaks of the remarkable country in which the sheep devour the men). </p>

<p>The cry of the people and the legislation directed, for 150 years after Henry VII, against the expropriation of the small farmers and peasants, were alike fruitless. </p>

<p>The process of forcible expropriation of the people received in the 16th century a new and frightful impulse from the Reformation, and from the consequent colossal spoliation of the church property. The Catholic church was, at the time of the Reformation, feudal proprietor of a great part of the English land. The suppression of the monasteries, &c., hurled their inmates into the proletariat. The estates of the church were to a large extent given away to rapacious royal favourites, or sold at a nominal price to speculating farmers and citizens, who drove out, en masse, the hereditary sub-tenants and threw their holdings into one. The legally guaranteed property of the poorer folk in a part of the church's tithes was tacitly confiscated. </p>

<p>Even in the last decades of the 17th century, the yeomanry, the class of independent peasants, were more numerous than the class of farmers. They had formed the backbone of Cromwell's strength, and, even according to the confession of Macaulay, stood in favourable contrast to the drunken squires and to their servants, the country clergy, who had to marry their master's cast-off mistresses. Even the agricultural wage-labourers were still co-proprietors of the common land. About 1750, the yeomanry had disappeared, and so had, in the last decades of the 18 th century, the last trace of the common land of the agricultural labourer. </p>

<p>After the restoration of the Stuarts, the landed proprietors carried, by legal means, an act of usurpation, effected everywhere on the Continent without any legal formality. They abolished the feudal tenure of land, <i>i e.</i>, they got rid of all its obligations of the State, ?indemnified? the State by taxes on the peasantry and the rest of the mass of the people, vindicated for themselves the rights of modern private property in estates to which they had only a feudal title, and, finally, passed those laws of settlement, which had the same effect on the English agricultural labourer, as the edict of the Tartar Boris Godunof on the Russian peasantry. </p>

<p>The ?glorious Revolution? brought into power, along with William of Orange, the landlord and capitalist appropriators of surplus-value. They inaugurated the new era by practising on a colossal scale thefts of state lands, thefts that had been hitherto managed more modestly. These estates were given away, sold at a ridiculous figure, or even annexed to private estates by direct seizure. All this happened without the slightest observation of legal etiquette. The crown lands thus fraudulently appropriated, together with the robbery of the Church estates, as far as these had not been lost again during the republican revolution, form the basis of the to-day princely domains of the English oligarchy. The bourgeois capitalists favoured the operation with the view, among others, to transforming land into a commercial article, to extending the domain of modern agriculture on the large farm-system, and to increasing their supply of the free agricultural proletarians ready to hand. Besides, the new landed aristocracy was the natural ally of the new bankocracy, of the newly-hatched <i>haute finance</i>, and of the large manufacturers, then depending on protective duties. </p>

<p>Whilst the place of the independent yeoman was taken by small farmers on yearly leases, a servile rabble dependent on the pleasure of the landlords, the systematic robbery of the Communal lands helped especially, next to the theft of the State domains, to swell those large farms, that were called in the 18th century capital farms or merchant farms, and to set free the agricultural population as proletarians for manufacturing industry. </p>

<p>In the 19th century, the very memory of the connexion between the agricultural labourer and the communal property had, of course, vanished. To say nothing of more recent times, have the agricultural population received a farthing of compensation for the 3 511 770 acres of common land which between 1801 and 1831 were stolen from them, and by parliamentary devices presented to the landlords by the landlords? </p>

<p>The last process of wholesale expropriation of the agricultural population from the soil is, finally, the so-called clearing of estates, <i>i. e.</i>, the sweeping men off them, the English methods hitherto considered culminated in clearing. But what "clearing of estates" really and properly signifies, we learn only in the promised land of modern romance, the Highlands of Scotland. </p>

<p>The Highland Celts were organised in clans, each of which was the owner of the land on which it was settled. The representative of the clan, its chief or "great man", was only the titular owner of this property, just as the Queen of England is the titular owner of all the national soil. When the English government succeeded in suppressing the intestine wars of these ?great men?, and their constant incursions into the Lowland plains, the chiefs of the clans by no means gave up their time-honoured trade as robbers; they only changed its form. On their own authority they transformed their nominal- right into a right of private property, and as this brought them into collision with their clansmen, resolved to drive them out by open force. In the 18th century the hunted-out Gaels were forbidden to emigrate from the country, with a view to driving them by force to Glasgow and other manufacturing towns. As an example of the method obtaining in the 19 th century, the ?clearing? made by the Duchess of Sutherland will suffice here. This person resolved on entering upon her government, to effect a radical economical cure, and to turn the whole country, whose population had already been, by earlier processes of the like kind, reduced to 15 000, into a sheepwalk. From 1814 to 1820 these 15 000 inhabitants, about 3000 families, were systematically hunted and rooted out. All their villages were destroyed and burnt, all their fields turned into pasturage. British soldiers enforced this eviction, and came to blows with the inhabitants. One old woman was burnt to death in the flames of the hut, which she refused to leave. Thus this fine lady appropriated 794000 acres of land that had from time immemorial belonged to the clan. She assigned to the expelled inhabitants about 6000 acres on the sea-shore 2 acres per family. The 6000 acres had until this time lain waste, and brought in no income to their owners. The Duchess, in the nobility of her heart, actually went so far as to let these at an average rent of 2 s. 6 d. per acre to the clansmen, who for centuries had shed their blood for her family. The whole of the stolen clan-land she divided into 29 great sheep farms, each inhabited by a single family, for the most part imported English farm-servants. In the year 1825 the 15000 Gaels were already replaced by 131 000 sheep. The remnant of the aborigines flung on the sea-shore, tried to live by catching fish. But they had to expiate yet more bitterly their idolatry, romantic and of the mountains, for the great men of the clan. The smell of their fish rose to the noses of the great men. They scented some profit in it, and let the sea-shore to the great fishmongers of London. For the second time the Gaels were hunted out. </p>

<p>But, finally, part of ,the sheep-walks are turned into deer preserves. Every one knows that there are no real forests in England. The deer in the parks of the great are demurely domestic cattle, fat as London aldermen. Scotland is therefore the last refuge of the ?noble passion?. ?In the Highlands?, says Somers in 1848 ?new forests are springing up like mushrooms . . . The transformation of their land into sheep-walks drove the Gaels on the sterile tracks of soil. Now deer are supplanting sheep; and these are once more reducing the small remnants to more grinding penury. Deer forests <a href="#n2" name="ref2">[2]</a> and the people cannot co-exist. One or other of the two must yield. Let the forests be increased in number and extent during the next quarter of a century, as they have been in the last, and the Gaels will perish from their native soil . . . This movement among the Highland proprietors is with some a matter of ambition . . . with some love of sport . . . while others, of a more practical cast, follow the trade in deer with an eye solely to profit. For it is a fact, that a mountain range laid out in forest is, in many cases, more profitable to the proprietor than when let as a sheep-walk . . . The huntsman who wants a deer-forest limits his offers by no other calculation than the extent of his purse . . . Sufferings have been inflicted in the Highlands scarcely less severe than those occasioned by the policy of the Norman kings . . . Deer have received extended ranges, while men have been hunted within a narrower and still narrower circle .... One after one the liberties of the people have been cloven down .... And the oppressions are daily on the increase . . . The clearance and dispersion; of the people is pursued by the proprietors as a settled principle, as an agricultural necessity., just as trees and brushwood are cleared from the wastes of America or Australia; and the operation goes on in a quiet, business-like way.? </p>

<p>The spoliation of the Church's property, the fraudulent alienation of the State domains, the robbery of the common lands, the usurpation of feudal and clan property, and its transformation into modern private property ruder circumstances of reckless terrorism, were just so many idyllic methods of primitive accumulation. They conquered the field for capitalistic agriculture, made the soil part and parcel of capital, and created for the town industries tin supply of an outlawed proletariat. </p>

<p>The proletariat thus deprived of its means of existence could not possibly be absorbed by the nascent manufactures as fast as it was thrown upon the world. On the other hand, these men, suddenly dragged from their wonted mode oi life, could not as suddenly adapt themselves to the discipline oi their new condition. They were turned <i>en masse</i> into beggars, robbers, vagabonds. Hence at the end of the 15th and during the whole of the 16th century, throughout Western Europe a bloody legislation against vagabondage. The fathers of the present working-class were chastised for their enforced transformation into vagabonds and paupers. Legislation treated them as ?voluntary? criminals, and assumed that it depended on their own good will to go on working under the old conditions that no longer existed. </p>

<p>At the time when the capitalist system of production originated, the bourgeoisie, at its rise, used the power of the State to "regulate" wages, to lengthen the working-day, and to keep the labourer himself in dependence. This is an essential element of the so-called primitive accumulation. </p>

<p>The class of wage-labourers, which arose in the latter half of the 14th century, formed then and in the following century only a very small part of the population, well protected in its position.! by the independent peasant proprietary in the country and the guild-organisation in the town. In country and town master and workmen stood close together socially. Variable capital preponderated greatly over constant. The demand for wage-labour grew, therefore, rapidly .with every accumulation of capital, whilst the supply of wage-labour followed but slowly. </p>

<p>Now that we have considered the forcible creation of a class of outlawed proletarians, the question remains: whence came the capitalists originally? For the expropriation of the agricultural population creates, directly, none but great landed proprietors. As far, however, as concerns the genesis of the farmer, we can, so to say, put our hand on it, because it is a slow process evolving through many centuries. In England the first form of the farmer is the bailiff, himself a serf. During the second half of the 14th century he is replaced by a farmer, whom the landlord provides with seed, cattle and implements. His condition is not very different from that of the peasant. Only he exploits more wage-labour. Soon he becomes a half-farmer. He advances one part of the agricultural stock, the landlord the other. The two divide the total product in proportions determined by contract. This form quickly disappears in England, to give place to the farmer proper, who makes his own capital breed by employing wage-labourers, and pays a part of the surplus product, in money or in kind, to the landlord as rent. So long, during the 15th century, as the independent peasant and the farm-labourer working for himself as well as for wages, enriched themselves by their own labour, the circumstances of the farmer, and his field of production, were equally mediocre. The agricultural revolution which commenced in the last third of the 15th century, and continued during almost the whole of the 16th (excepting, however, its last decades), enriched him just as speedily as it impoverished, the mass of the agricultural people. The usurpation of the common lands allowed him to augment greatly his stock of cattle, almost without cost, whilst the cattle yielded him a richer supply of manure for the tillage of the soil. To this, was added in the 16th century, a very important element. At that time the contracts for farms ran for a long time, often for 99 years. The progressive fall in the value of the precious metals, and therefore of money, brought the farmers golden fruit. Apart from all the other circumstances discussed above, it lowered w A portion of the latter was now added to the profits of the farm. The continuous rise in the corn, wool, nu a word of all agricultural produce, swelled the money capital of the farmer without any action on* his part, whilst the rent he paid, was calculated on the old value of money. Thus they grew rich at the expense both of their labourers and their landlords. No wonder therefore, that England, at the end of the 16th century, had a class of capitalist fanners, rich, considering the circumstances of the time. </p>

<p>The expropriation and expulsion of the agricultural population, intermittent but. renewed again and again, supplied, as we saw, the town industries with a mass of proletarians entirely unconnected with the corporate guilds. The thinning out of the independent, self-supporting peasants not only corresponded to the increasing density of the industrial proletariat. In spite of the smaller number of its cultivators, the soil brought forth as much or more produce, after as before, because the revolution in the conditions of landed property was accompanied by improved methods of culture, greater co-operation, concentration of the means of production, &c., and because not only were the agricultural wage-labourers put on the strain more intensely, but the field of production on which they worked for themselves became more and more contracted. With the setting free of a part of the agricultural population, therefore, their former means of nourishment were also set free. The peasant expropriated must buy their value in the form of wages, from his new master, the industrial capitalist. That which holds good of the means of subsistence holds with the raw materials of industry created by home agriculture. Suppose, <i>e. g.</i>, a part of the Westphalian peasants, who, at the time of Frederic II., all span flax, forcibly expropriated and hunted from the soil; and the other part that remained, turned into day-labourers of large farmers. At the same time arise large establishments for flax-spinning and weaving, in which the men set free now work for wages. The flax looks exactly as before. Not a fibre of it is changed, but a new social soul has popped into its body. It forms now a part of the constant capital of the master manufacturer. Formerly divided among a number of small producers, who cultivated it themselves and with their families spun it in retail fashion, it is now concentrated in the hand of one capitalist, who sets others to spin and weave it for him. The extra labour expended in flax-spinning realised itself formerly in extra income to numerous peasant families, or may be, in Frederic IPs time, in taxes. It realises itself now in profit for a few capitalists. The spindles and looms, formerly scattered over the face of the country, are now crowded together in a few great labour-barracks, together with the labourers and the raw material. And spindles, looms, raw material, are now transformed, from means of independent existence for the spinners and weavers, into means for commanding them and sucking out of them unpaid labour. One does not perceive, when looking at the large manufactories and the large farms, that they have originated from the throwing into one of many small centres of production, and have been built up by the expropriation of many small independent producers. </p>

<p>The expropriation and eviction of a part of the agricultural population not only set free for industrial capital the labourers, their means of subsistence, and material for labour; it also created the home market. </p>

<p>Formerly, the peasant family produced the means of subsistence and the raw materials, which they themselves, for the most part, consumed. These raw materials and means of subsistence have now become commodities; the large farmer sells them, he finds his market in manufactures. Yarn, linen, coarse woollen stuffs things whose raw materials had been within the reach of every peasant family, had been spun and woven by it for its own use - - were now transformed into articles of manufacture, to which the country districts at once served for markets. Thus, hand in hand with the expropriation of the self-supporting peasants, with their separation from their means of production, goes the destruction of rural domestic industry. And only the destruction of rural domestic industry can give the internal market of a country that extension and consistence which the capitalist mode of production requires. Still the manufacturing period, properly so-called, does not succeed in carrying out this transformation radically and completely. Modern industry alone supplies, in machinery, the lasting basis of capitalistic agriculture, expropriates radically the enormous majority of the agricultural population, and completes the separation between agriculture and rural domestic industry, whose roots spinning and weaving - it tears up. It therefore also, for the first time, conquers for industrial capital the entire home market. </p>

<p>The genesis of the industrial capitalist did not proceed in such a gradual way as that of the farmer. Doubtless many small guild-masters, and even wage-labourers, transformed themselves into small capitalists, and (by gradually extending exploitation of wage- labour and corresponding accumulation) into full-blown capitalists. The snail's pace of this method corresponded in no wise with the commercial requirements of the new world market that the great discoveries of the end of the 15th century created. But the middle ages had handed down two distinct forms of capital, usurer's capital and merchant's capital. </p>

<p>The money capital formed by means of usury and commerce was prevented from turning into industrial capital, in the country by the feudal constitution, in the towns by the guild organisation. Even as late as 1794. the small clothmakers of Leeds sent a deputation to Parliament, with a petition for a law to forbid any merchant from becoming a manufacturer. These fetters vanished with the dissolution of feudal society, with the expropriation and partial eviction of the country population. The new manufactures were established at sea-ports, or at inland points beyond the control of the old municipalities and their guilds. Hence in England an! embittered struggle of the corporate towns against these new industrial nurseries. </p>

<p>The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalised the dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation. On their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations. with the globe for a theatre. It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands from Spain, assumes giant dimensions in England's anti-jacobin war, and is still going on in the opium wars against China, &c. </p>

<p>The different momenta of primitive accumulation distribute themselves now, more or less in chronological order, particularly over Spain, Portugal, Holland, France, and England. In England at the end of the 17th century, they arrive at a systematical combination in the colonies, the national debt, the modern mode of taxation, and the protectionist regime. These methods depend in part on brute force, <i>e. g.</i>, the colonial system. But they all employ the power of the State to hasten in hothouse fashion the process of transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist mode, and to shorten the transition. Force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one. It is itself an economic power. </p>

<p>Of the Christian colonial system, W. Howitt, a man who makes a speciality of Christianity, says: ?The barbarities and desperate outrages of the so-called Christian race, throughout every region of the world, and upon every people they have been able to subdue, are not to be paralleled by those of any other race, however fierce, however untaught, and however reckless of mercy and of shame, in any age of the earth.? <a href="#n3" name="ref3">[3]</a> The history of -the colonial administration of Holland - and Holland was the head capitalistic nation of the 17th century ? ?is one of the most extraordinary relations of treachery, bribery, massacre, and meanness". <a href="#n4" name="ref4">[4]</a> To secure Malacca, the Dutch corrupted the Portuguese governor. He let them into the town in 1641. They hurried at once to his house and assassinated him, to ?abstain? from the payment of £ 21 875, the price of his treason. Wherever they set foot, devastation and depopulation followed. Banjuwangi, a province of Java in 1750 numbered over 80000 inhabitants, in 1811 only 8000. </p>

<p>The English East India Company, as is well known, obtained, besides the political rule in India, the exclusive monopoly of the tea-trade, as well as of the Chinese trade ini general, and of the transport of goods to and from Europe. But the coasting trade t of India and between the islands, as well as the internal trade of India were the monopoly of the higher officials of the company. The monopolies of salt, opium, betel and other commodities, were inexhaustible mines of wealth. The officials themselves fixed the price and plundered at will the unhappy Hindus. The Governor General took part in this private traffic. His favourites received contracts under conditions whereby they, cleverer than the alchemists, made gold out of nothing. Great fortunes sprang up like mushrooms in a day; primitive accumulation went on without the advance of a shilling. The trial of Warren Hastings swarms with such cases. Here is an instance. A contract for opium was given to a certain Sullivan at the moment of his departure on an official mission to a part of India far removed from the opium district. Sullivan sold his contract to one Binn for £40000; Binn sold it the same day for £60000, and the ultimate purchaser who carried out the contract declared that after all he realised an enormous gain. According to one of the lists laid before Parliament, the Company and its officials between 1757-1766 got £6000000 from the Indians as gifts. Between 1769 and 1770, the English manufactured a famine by buying up all the rice and refusing to sell it again, except at fabulous prices. </p>

<p>The colonial system ripened, like a hot-house, trade and navigation. The ?societies Monopolia? of Luther were powerful levers for concentration of. capital. The colonies furnished a market for the budding manufactures, and, through the monopoly of the market, an increased accumulation. The treasures captured outside Europe oy undisguised looting enslavement, and murder, floated back to the mother-country und were there turned. into capital. Holland, which first fully developed the colonial system, in 1648 stood already in the acme of its commercial greatness. It was ?in almost exclusive possession of the East Indian trade and the commerce between the south-west and north-east of Europe. Its fisheries, marine, manufactures, surpassed those of any other country. The total capital of the Republic was probably more important than that of all the rest of Europe put together.? Gülich forgets to add that by 1648 the people of Holland were more overworked, poorer and more brutally oppressed than those of all the rest of Europe put together. </p>

<p>To-day industrial supremacy implies commercial supremacy. In the period of manufacture properly so-called, it is, on the contrary, the commercial supremacy that gives industrial predominance. Hence the preponderant role that the colonial system played at that time. It was ?the strange God? who perched himself on the altar cheek by jowl with the old Gods of Europe, and one fine day with a shove and a kick overthrew them all. It proclaimed surplus-value making as the sole end and aim of humanity. </p>

<p>The system of public credit, <i>i. e.</i> of national debts, whose origin we discover in Genoa and Venice as early as the middle ages, took possession of Europe generally during the manufacturing period. The colonial system with its maritime trade and commercial wars served as a forcing-house for it. Thus it first took root in Holland. National debts, <i>i. e.</i>, the alienation of the State - whether despotic, constitutional or republican - marked with its stamp the capitalistic era. The only part of the so-called national wealth that actually enters into the collective possessions of modern peoples is their national debt. </p>

<p>The public debt becomes one of the powerful levers of primitive accumulation. As with the stroke of an enchanter's wand, it endows barren money with the power of breeding and thus turns it into capital, without the necessity of its exposing itself to the troubles and risks inseparable from its employment in industry or even in usury. The State-creditors actually give nothing away, for the sum lent is transformed into public bonds, easily negotiable, which go on functioning in their hands just as so much hard cash would. But further, apart from the class of lazy annuitants thus created, and from the improvised wealth" of the financiers, middlemen between the government and the nation - as also apart from the tax-farmers, merchants, private manufacturers, to whom a good part of every State loan renders the service of a capital fallen from heaven - the national debt has given rise to joint-stock companies, to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds, and to agiotage, in a word to stock-exchange gambling and the modern bankocracy. </p>

<p>From their birth on the great banks, decorated with national titles, were only associations of private speculators, who placed themselves by the side of governments, and, thanks to the privileges they received, were in a position to advance money to the State. Hence the accumulation of the national debt has no more infallible measure than the successive rise in the stock of these banks, whose full development dates from the founding of the Bank of England in 1694. The Bank of England began with lending its money to the Government at 8 % ; at the same time it was empowered by Parliament to coin money out of the same capital, by lending it again to the public in the form of bank-notes. It was allowed to use these notes for discounting bills, making advances on commodities, and for buying the precious metals. It was not long before this credit-money, made by the bank itself, became the coin in which the Bank of England made its loans to the State, and paid on account of the State the interest on the public debt. It was not enough that the bank gave with one hand and took back more with the other; it remained, even whilst receiving, the eternal creditor of the nation down to the last shilling advanced. Gradually it became the inevitable receptacle of the metallic hoard of the country, and the centre of gravity of all commercial credit. At the same time as England ceased burning witches, she began to hang the forgers of banknotes. What effect was produced on their contemporaries by the uprising of this brood of bankocrats, financiers, rentiers, brokers, stock-jobbers, &c., is proved by the writings of that time. </p>

<p>With the national debt arose an international credit System, which often conceals one of the sources of primitive accumulation in this or that people. Thus the villanies of the Venetian thieving system formed one of the secret bases of the capital-wealth of Holland, to whom Venice in her decadence lent large sums of money. So also was it with Holland and England. Already at the beginning of the 18th century the Dutch manufactures were far outstripped. Holland had ceased to be the nation preponderant in commerce and industry. One of its main lines of business, therefore from 1701-1776, is the lending out of enormous amounts of capital, especially to its great rival England. The same thing is going on to-day (1867) between England and the United States. </p>

<p>As the national debt finds its support in the public revenue which must cover the yearly payments for interest, &c., the modern system of taxation was the necessary complement of the system of national loans. The loans enable the government to meet extraordinary expenses, without the tax-payers feeling it immediately, but they necessitate as a consequence, increased taxes. On the other hand, the raising of taxation caused by the accumulation of debts contracted one after another compels the government always to have recourse to new loans for new extraordinary expenses. Modern fiscality, whose pivot is formed by taxes on the most necessary means of subsistence (thereby increasing their price), thus contains within itself the germ of automatic progression. Over-taxation is not an incident, but rather a principle. In Holland, therefore, where this system was first inaugurated, the great patriot, De Witt, has extolled it as the best system for making the wage-labourer submissive, frugal, industrious, and overburdened with labour. The destructive influence that it exercises on the condition of the wage-labourer concerns us less however, here, than the forcible expropriation resulting from it. of peasants, artisans, and in a word, all elements of the lower middle-class. On this there are not two opinions, even among the bourgeois economists. Its expropriating efficacy is still further heightened by the system of protection, which forms one of its integral parts. </p>

<p>The system of protection was an artificial means of manufacturing manufacturers, of expropriating independent labourers of capitalising the national means of production and subsistence, of forcibly abreviating the transition from the mediaeval to the modern mode of production. The European states tore one another to pieces about the patent of this invention, and, once entered into the service of the surplus-value makers, did not merely lay under contribution in the pursuit of this purpose their own people, indirectly through projective duties, directly through export premiums, &c. They also forcibly rooted out, in their dependent countries, all industry, as, <i>e. g.</i>, England did with the Irish woollen manufacture. On the continent of Europe, after Colbert's example, the process was much simplified. The primitive industrial capital, here, came in part directly out of the State treasury. </p>

<p>Colonial system, public debts, heavy taxes, protection, commercial wars, &c. these children of the true manufacturing period increase gigantically during the infancy of modern industry. </p>

<p>So much trouble was thus required to complete the process of separation between labourers and conditions of labour, to transform at one pole, the social means of production and subsistence into capital, at the opposite pole, the mass of the population into wage-labourers. If money, according to Augier comes into the world with a congenital blood-stain on one cheek, capital comes dripping from to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt. <a href="#n5" name="ref5">[5]</a> </p>

Capital eschews no profit, or very small profit, just as Nature was formerly said to abhor a vacuum. With adequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 per cent will ensure its employment anywhere; 20 per cent, certain will produce eagerness; 50 per cent., positive audacity; 100 per cent, will make it ready to trample on ail human laws; 300 per cent., and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, even to the chance of its owner being hanged. If turbulence and strife will bring a profit, it will freely encourage both. Smuggling and the slave-trade have amply proved all that is here stated.? (T. J.
